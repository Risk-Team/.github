### Hi there, we are the risk group in the environment workstream (OCB division) at FAO 

We are a group of experts on the impact of climate change on different ecosystems and we approach risk from its multiple component (hazard, exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity).   

Our activities go beyond conducting climate risk assessments. We also develop a range of different tools, targeting both people with experience in programming and also the general public.  
  
#### We started developing tools that can be used to process climate models and other climate related datasets

- 🏢 We are currently working with **CORDEX-CORE** climate models.
- 🌍 We support **GEF and GCF** projects.
- 🌱 We develop tools that could better link climate science and policy.  
- 🌱 We develop tools for automatic processing of crop model output simulations, in this case Aquacrop (FAO).
